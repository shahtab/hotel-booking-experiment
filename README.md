# hotel-booking-experiment
Develop mechanisms to interact with various publicly available hotel booking APIs


All the scripts expect to be run with Python3 ... I have tested them with 3.7 but ideally should use 3.8+

We need to run a few components locally to test functionalities

	- Redis 
	- Elasticsearch 7.x and Kibana
	- Vault

Each of the python scripts  have some dependencies on python modules so install them beforehand
